# Auto Chess Clash

A strategy game prototype in the style of Auto Chess, inspired by Clash Royale.

## Overview

This is a simple game where you can position your units on a battlefield and then start a battle to watch them fight automatically. The goal is to destroy the enemy base before yours is destroyed.

## How to Play

1.  **Planning Phase:**
    * At the bottom of the screen, you will find a selection bar with available units (Warrior, Archer, Mage, Rogue).
    * Drag and drop units from the selection bar into your zone on the battlefield (the blue zone at the bottom).
    * You can remove a unit you placed by clicking on it during the planning phase.

2.  **Battle Phase:**
    * When you are satisfied with the positioning of your units, click the "⚔️ START BATTLE ⚔️" button.
    * The units will start moving and attacking the nearest enemy units or the enemy base.
    * The battle ends when one of the bases is destroyed.

## Current Features

* **4 Unit Types:** Warrior, Archer, Mage, and Rogue, each with unique stats and visuals.
* **Game Phases:** A planning phase for positioning units and an automatic combat phase.
* **Combat System:** Units have stats like HP, attack, range, and attack speed.
* **Simple AI:** Units search for and attack the nearest target, whether it's an enemy unit or the enemy base.
* **Visual Feedback:** Projectiles, floating damage text, and health bars.

## Technologies Used

## Future Ideas

* Make unit behavior more complex.
* Gold/Elixir system to buy units.
* Special abilities for units.
* More unit types and synergies between them.
* An AI opponent that also positions units.
* Improvements to the user interface and visual effects.
